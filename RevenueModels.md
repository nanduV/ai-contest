# Revenue Models #

This page discusses ways to raise revenue for the contest to pay for servers, prizes, and other costs.

## Ads ##

But seriously... ads may be a viable revenue model for the contest.

Large ad networks like Google seem to operate on a cost-per-click (CPC) model for the most part. This means that we get paid every time a visitor clicks on one of the ads. The revenue per click is not fixed, and can vary quite a bit. It's difficult to estimate it. Also, a big unknown is what fraction of visitors to a programming contest website would click ads. The bad news is that it may be quite low. Under this much uncertainty, it's difficult to venture a guess as to how much revenue CPC advertising might generate.

Some smaller ad networks that deal only with relatively high-traffic sites operate on a cost-per-thounsand-impressions (CPM) model. That means you get paid whenever the ad is loaded, not just when it's clicked. I have seen some evidence that typical CPMs are around $5 to $40 per thousand impressions for large sites. The Winter 2010 contest received over a million impressions. Assuming a CPM of $1 and traffic of one million impression per month, that turns into revenue of $1000 per month. This is enough to pay for 10 low-end dedicated servers. This calculation is very approximate and should be taken with a grain of salt.

## Corporate Sponsorship ##

This would probably take the form of some big tech company giving us a few thousand dollars to sponsor the contest. In exchange, we could offer:
  * **Naming Rights.** For example, the Google Tron AI Challenge, the Facebook FarmVille AI Challenge, or the Pokerstars AI Challenge.
  * **Product Placement.** We would make a point of using one of their products, and make a big fuss about it on the website. Think "this contest powered by Microsoft IIS", or "these rankings powered by Oracle".

## Recruitment ##

Turn the contest into a recruiting service. At the end of the contest, we would ask the top N ranked contestants if they would like to have their resumes and contact information forwarded to a recruiter at company X. We would basically be operating a fun-to-use headhunting service that matches the top talent with the top employers. We would monetize this using some linear combination of the following:
  * **Finders' Fees.** They say that a headhunter collects a finders' fee between 20% and 50% of the first years' salary for a successful hire.
  * **Referral Fees.** We could charge a fixed fee per top-ranked contestant that we send them.

In this model, we can use a combination of finders' fees and referral fees in order to strike the right balance between risk and reward for the contest as well as the firm doing the hiring.

## Donations ##

To collect donations, slap a big "Donate" button on the website somewhere. Be very open about what the money is being used for and how much is being donated.
