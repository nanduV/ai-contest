# Starter Package Strategy #

The basic strategy given in the starter package waits until you have no ships in flight and then picks your strongest planet and sends half of that fleet to attack the weakest planet. Here are a list of possible improvements that we have though of that may make an AI stronger.

# Improvement #1 #

Pick the planet that has the highest production to strength ratio of the planets that aren't owned by the player and attack it with your strongest planet.

# Improvement #2 #

Check to see if the planet that will be attacked next is stronger than half of your fleet. If it is stronger, don't attack.

# Improvement #3 #

Excluding the planet currently being attacked, attack a second planet that has the next highest production to strength ratio with your second strongest planet.
