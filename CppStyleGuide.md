# C++ Style Guide #

Although we are not strictly enforcing any style guide at this time, there are a few recommendations that we ask that you take into consideration:
  * For C++, try to stick to the [Google C++ Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml)
  * Consistency is key. If you are editing or adding code to an existing module, be courteous and match the style of the surrounding code.
